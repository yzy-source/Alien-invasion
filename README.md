# Alien-invasion
A game named 'Alien-invasion'

The player controls a spaceship that initially appears at the bottom center of the screen. Use the left and right arrows to move the spaceship and use the space bar to shoot. At the beginning of the game, a group of aliens appeared in the sky. They moved down to the screen. The player's task was to shoot these aliens. After the player wipes out all the aliens, a new group of aliens will appear, and they will move faster. As long as an alien hits the playerâ€™s spaceship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will lose a spaceship. After the player loses three spaceships, the game ends.
